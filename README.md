# Proxy DDoS

This Python script can perform a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack by overwhelming a target website with requests from multiple proxies.

**This should only be used for authorized testing of your own systems - attacking websites without permission is illegal!** 

## Usage

1. Update `proxies.txt` with proxy URLs, one per line.

2. Run the script: 

3. Enter the target URL when prompted.

The script spins up threads to bombard the target with requests via the proxies, overwhelming the target website.

## Features

- Multi-threaded requests via proxies for powerful DDoS capability  
- SOCKS proxy support for anonymity
- Customizable list of proxies

## Upcoming Features

- Randomized user agents 
- Traffic encryption
